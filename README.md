# ballMapper

`ballMapper` is a Python implementation of the **Ball Mapper** algorithm for building graph-based summaries of high-dimensional point cloud data.

This implementation focuses on efficient cover construction using:

- `scikit-learn`'s `BallTree`
- Optional `FAISS` support for faster nearest-neighbor searches on larger datasets
- Greedy landmark selection
- Deterministic farthest point sampling
- NetworkX graph construction
- Matplotlib and Plotly visualization utilities
- Node coloring by size, density, labels, entropy, or custom functions

---

## What is Ball Mapper?

Ball Mapper is a topological data analysis method that summarizes the shape of a dataset as a graph.

Given a point cloud and a radius `eps`, the algorithm:

1. Selects representative points called **landmarks**
2. Builds an `eps`-ball around each landmark
3. Creates a graph where each node represents a ball
4. Connects two nodes if their balls share at least one data point

The resulting graph can reveal clusters, branches, loops, transitions, and other large-scale geometric structure in the data.

---

## Features

- Compute Ball Mapper landmarks using a greedy covering strategy
- Compute landmarks using deterministic farthest point sampling
- Use the same distance definition for FPS selection and cover queries
- Construct an `eps`-net under the selected FPS metric
- Pass metric-specific options through `metricKwargs`
- Build Ball Mapper graphs using `networkx`
- Use `BallTree` for efficient metric-aware distance and radius queries
- Optionally use `FAISS` for Euclidean or cosine search
- Color graph nodes by:
  - Custom function values
  - Most common class label
  - Label entropy
  - Ball size
  - Ball density
- Visualize graphs with:
  - Matplotlib
  - Interactive Plotly figures
- Export interactive visualizations to HTML

```

For GPU-enabled FAISS, follow the official FAISS installation instructions for your platform.

---

## Dependencies

Required:

```text
numpy
networkx
matplotlib
plotly
scikit-learn
```

Optional:

```text
faiss-cpu
```

`FAISS` is only required when using `method="faiss"`.

---

## Basic Usage

### 1. Generate or load data

```python
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)

# Example point cloud with 500 samples and 2 features
X = np.random.rand(500, 2)
```

`X` should be a NumPy array with shape:

```text
(n_samples, n_features)
```

---

## Compute Landmarks and Covers

The package provides two main landmark construction methods:

1. `computeLandmarks`
2. `computeLandmarksFPS`

---

## Method 1: Greedy Landmark Selection

The greedy method iterates through the dataset and selects the first uncovered point as a new landmark. It then marks all points within distance `eps` as covered.

```python
from ballMapper import computeLandmarks

eps = 0.1

landmarks, cover = computeLandmarks(
    X,
    eps=eps,
    method="ballTree",
    metric="euclidean",
    leafSize=40,
)
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `X` | `np.ndarray` | required | Input data of shape `(n_samples, n_features)` |
| `eps` | `float` | required | Radius of each Ball Mapper ball |
| `method` | `"ballTree"` or `"faiss"` | `"ballTree"` | Backend used for radius queries |
| `metric` | `str` | `"euclidean"` | Distance metric; BallTree supports its available metrics, while FAISS supports only Euclidean and cosine |
| `leafSize` | `int` | `40` | Leaf size used by BallTree |
| `metricKwargs` | mapping or `None` | `None` | Extra BallTree metric arguments, such as `{"p": 3}` or `{"VI": VI}`; not supported by FAISS |

### Return values

```python
landmarks, cover
```

where:

- `landmarks` is a list of landmark point indices
- `cover` is a list of NumPy arrays
- each `cover[i]` contains the indices of data points inside the ball around `landmarks[i]`

---

## Method 2: Farthest Point Sampling

Farthest point sampling repeatedly selects the point whose distance to its nearest current landmark is largest. The selection step and the final cover queries use the same `method`, `metric`, and `metricKwargs` configuration.

The algorithm stops when the largest nearest-landmark distance is at most `eps`. Therefore, the returned landmarks form an `eps`-net under the selected distance:

- Every point is within distance `eps` of at least one landmark.
- Every pair of distinct selected landmarks is more than `eps` apart.

```python
from ballMapper import computeLandmarksFPS

landmarks, cover = computeLandmarksFPS(
    X,
    eps=eps,
    start_index=None,
    method="ballTree",
    metric="euclidean",
    leafSize=40,
)
```

When `start_index=None`, the algorithm starts from the lexicographically smallest point, giving deterministic behavior.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `X` | `np.ndarray` | required | Input data of shape `(n_samples, n_features)` |
| `eps` | `float` | required | Stopping radius for FPS and radius of the final cover |
| `start_index` | `int` or `None` | `None` | Optional starting point for FPS |
| `method` | `"ballTree"` or `"faiss"` | `"ballTree"` | Backend used for both FPS distances and cover queries |
| `metric` | `str` | `"euclidean"` | Distance metric used consistently by FPS and the cover |
| `leafSize` | `int` | `40` | BallTree leaf size |
| `metricKwargs` | mapping or `None` | `None` | Extra BallTree metric arguments; not supported by FAISS |

---

## Using Other BallTree Metrics

Both `computeLandmarks` and `computeLandmarksFPS` accept BallTree metrics. For metrics that do not need extra parameters, pass the metric name directly:

```python
landmarks, cover = computeLandmarksFPS(
    X,
    eps=0.2,
    method="ballTree",
    metric="manhattan",
)
```

For parameterized metrics, use `metricKwargs`.

### Minkowski distance

```python
landmarks, cover = computeLandmarksFPS(
    X,
    eps=0.2,
    method="ballTree",
    metric="minkowski",
    metricKwargs={"p": 3},
)
```

### Mahalanobis distance

```python
VI = np.linalg.pinv(np.cov(X, rowvar=False))

landmarks, cover = computeLandmarksFPS(
    X,
    eps=0.2,
    method="ballTree",
    metric="mahalanobis",
    metricKwargs={"VI": VI},
)
```

The numerical meaning of `eps` depends on the selected metric, so values that are suitable for Euclidean distance may not be suitable for another metric.

---

## Using FAISS

FAISS can be used instead of BallTree for Euclidean or cosine search on larger datasets. In `computeLandmarksFPS`, the same FAISS distance semantics are used for landmark selection and cover construction.

`metricKwargs` is not supported with `method="faiss"`.

### Euclidean FAISS

```python
landmarks, cover = computeLandmarks(
    X,
    eps=0.1,
    method="faiss",
    metric="euclidean",
)
```

For Euclidean FAISS, `eps` is interpreted as a Euclidean distance radius.

---

### Cosine FAISS

```python
landmarks, cover = computeLandmarks(
    X,
    eps=0.1,
    method="faiss",
    metric="cosine",
)
```

For cosine FAISS, the data is internally normalized and neighbors are selected using:

```text
cosine_similarity >= 1 - eps
```

So `eps` behaves like a cosine-distance radius. Cosine distance is undefined for zero vectors, and the implementation rejects input containing them.

---

## Build the Ball Mapper Graph

Once you have a cover, build the Ball Mapper graph:

```python
from ballMapper import buildMapper

G = buildMapper(cover)
```

The graph is a `networkx.Graph`.

- Each node represents one landmark ball
- An edge connects two balls if they contain at least one shared data point

```python
print(G.number_of_nodes())
print(G.number_of_edges())
```

---

## Complete Minimal Example

```python
import numpy as np
from ballMapper import computeLandmarks, buildMapper

np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(500, 2)

eps = 0.1

landmarks, cover = computeLandmarks(
    X,
    eps=eps,
    method="ballTree",
)

G = buildMapper(cover)

print(f"Number of landmarks: {len(landmarks)}")
print(f"Number of graph nodes: {G.number_of_nodes()}")
print(f"Number of graph edges: {G.number_of_edges()}")
```

---

## Node Coloring

The package includes several helper functions for assigning values to Ball Mapper nodes.

---

### Color by Ball Size

```python
from ballMapper import colorBySize

sizes = colorBySize(cover)
```

This returns the number of data points contained in each ball.

---

### Color by Density

```python
from ballMapper import colorByDensity

density = colorByDensity(cover)
```

This normalizes ball sizes by the largest ball size.

---

### Color by a Custom Function

```python
from ballMapper import colorByFunction

colors = colorByFunction(X, cover, func=np.mean)
```

This applies a function to the points contained in each ball.

For example, to color by the average first coordinate:

```python
colors = colorByFunction(X[:, 0], cover, func=np.mean)
```

---

### Color by Most Common Label

```python
from ballMapper import colorByMode

y = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=X.shape[0])

colors = colorByMode(y, cover)
```

This assigns each node the most frequent label among the points in its ball.

---

### Color by Label Entropy

```python
from ballMapper import colorByEntropy

entropy = colorByEntropy(y, cover)
```

This measures how mixed the labels are inside each ball.

Low entropy means a ball mostly contains one class.

High entropy means a ball contains a mixture of classes.

---

## Matplotlib Visualization

Use `drawBallMapper` for a static NetworkX/Matplotlib visualization.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ballMapper import drawBallMapper, addColorbar, colorBySize

sizes = colorBySize(cover)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))

pos, nodes = drawBallMapper(
    G,
    colors=sizes,
    sizes=sizes,
    layout="spring",
    cmap="viridis",
    with_labels=True,
    node_scale=500,
    ax=ax,
)

addColorbar(nodes, ax, label="Ball size")

plt.show()
```

### Available layouts

```python
layout="spring"
layout="kamada_kawai"
layout="spectral"
```

---

## Interactive Plotly Visualization

Use `drawBallMapperPlotly` for interactive visualizations with hover text and optional dropdown colorings.

```python
from ballMapper import (
    drawBallMapperPlotly,
    colorBySize,
    colorByDensity,
    colorByFunction,
)

size_coloring = colorBySize(cover)
density_coloring = colorByDensity(cover)
mean_x_coloring = colorByFunction(X[:, 0], cover, func=np.mean)

colorings = {
    "Ball size": size_coloring,
    "Density": density_coloring,
    "Mean x-coordinate": mean_x_coloring,
}

drawBallMapperPlotly(
    G,
    cover,
    colorings=colorings,
    sizes=size_coloring,
    layout="spring",
    node_scale=25,
)
```

---

## Export Plotly Graph to HTML

```python
drawBallMapperPlotly(
    G,
    cover,
    colorings=colorings,
    sizes=size_coloring,
    export_html="ball_mapper_graph.html",
)
```

This creates a standalone interactive HTML file.

---

## Edge Overlaps

You can compute how many data points are shared between connected balls:

```python
from ballMapper import computeEdgeOverlaps

overlaps = computeEdgeOverlaps(cover, G)

for edge, overlap_size in overlaps.items():
    print(edge, overlap_size)
```

This can be useful for measuring how strongly two Ball Mapper nodes are connected.

)
```

## Choosing `eps`

The parameter `eps` controls the size of the balls. Its scale is metric-dependent: the same numeric value can produce very different covers under Euclidean, Manhattan, cosine, Mahalanobis, or another distance.

Smaller `eps` values usually produce:

- More landmarks
- More graph nodes
- Finer local structure
- Potentially fragmented graphs

Larger `eps` values usually produce:

- Fewer landmarks
- Fewer graph nodes
- More global structure
- More overlap between balls

Example:

```python
for eps in [0.05, 0.1, 0.2]:
    landmarks, cover = computeLandmarks(X, eps=eps)
    G = buildMapper(cover)

    print(
        f"eps={eps}: "
        f"{G.number_of_nodes()} nodes, "
        f"{G.number_of_edges()} edges"
    )
```

## BallTree vs FAISS

### Use BallTree when:

- Your dataset is small to medium sized
- You want support for scikit-learn BallTree distance metrics
- You need metric-specific parameters through `metricKwargs`
- You do not want to install FAISS
- You need a simple CPU-based backend

### Use FAISS when:

- Your dataset is large
- You want faster Euclidean or cosine similarity search
- You are working with high-dimensional vector embeddings
- You already use FAISS in your workflow

## Common Errors

### `ImportError: scikit-learn is required for BallTree method`

Install scikit-learn:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

---

### `ImportError: FAISS is required for method='faiss'`

Install FAISS:

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu
```

---

### `ValueError: Method must be 'ballTree' or 'faiss'`

Use one of the supported backends:

```python
method="ballTree"
```

or:

```python
method="faiss"
```

When using FAISS, the supported metrics are:

```python
metric="euclidean"
metric="cosine"
```

Passing a non-empty `metricKwargs` mapping with `method="faiss"` raises a `ValueError`.

---

### `ValueError: Cosine distance is undefined for zero vectors`

Remove zero vectors, replace them with meaningful nonzero representations, or use a metric other than cosine.

---

## Notes

- `cover[i]` contains the indices of the data points covered by node `i`.
- Graph node IDs correspond to positions in the `cover` list, not directly to original data indices.
- To retrieve the landmark point for graph node `i`, use:

```python
landmark_index = landmarks[i]
landmark_point = X[landmark_index]
```

- `computeLandmarksFPS` uses the same backend, metric, and metric parameters for FPS distances and cover queries.
- FPS stops when every point is within `eps` of a selected landmark under that distance.
- `metricKwargs` is available only with `method="ballTree"`.
- FAISS internally converts data to `float32`.
- Cosine FAISS normalizes the input vectors before indexing and rejects zero vectors.
- Plotly visualizations call `fig.show()` and can optionally export to HTML.
